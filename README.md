# Deep Learning with Keras

A high level framework for building neural networks with only a few lines of code.

Keras is front end layer written in Python that runs on top of other popular deep learning toolkits

### Backends:

Keras uses either TensorFlow or Theano behind the scenes to do all its calculations

## What Makes Keras Unique?

Industry best practices are built in

The Default settings in Keras are designed to give you good results in most cases

Build in image recognition models

## Theano

Created at MILA (Montreal Institute for Learning Algorithms) at the University of Montreal

Works well with Python

GPU accelaration

## TensorFlow

Created at Google

GPU accelaration

Distribuited Computing
